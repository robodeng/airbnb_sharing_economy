TO DO:

-) Impute weekend values into weekend spots
-) calculate estimated cleaning fees based on listing -->listings table cleaning_fee
	ISNULL == True values are assumed to NOT have a cleaning fee??? Is this reasonable assumption?

-) listings['host_response_rate'], listings['host_acceptance_rate']->clean by str.replace('%','')

-) Convert listings['host_is_superhost']

-) Write a for loop to clean code vs this way I am doing now....
-) Clean listings['extra_people']: DONE
	-Place this in appropriate section of Jup Notebook


DUMMY VARIABLES
-) listings['property_type'] into dummy variable 
-) listings['bed_type'] into dummy variable
-) listings['mainzip'] into dummy variable or possibly neighborhood

QUESTION: Hosting Agencies in this group

How is success measured?
Reviews/month? problem- what about people that rent consistently for longer periods of time
number_of_reviews? same issue- people might rent for long time
Proxy metric- HYPOTHESIS: people who...(have many properties, high reviews, high # of reviews per month,)
Reviews_per_month (by listing), host_properties (by host)
ASSUMPTION: "Super hosts w/5 or more properties" are available throughout calendar data set





WE REALIZED THAT CAN'T BACK INTO REVENUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
